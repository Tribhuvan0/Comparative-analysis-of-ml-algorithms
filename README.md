### House Price Prediction using different machine learning models

### Author: [Tribhuvan Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tribhuvan0/)

This project aims to predict the house price by using given set of variables and also to find which algorithm gives best performance

This repository contains the notebook associated with the task performed
* Notebook has well written code along with markdowns, where additional information is given.
* Notebook also has sufficient visualizaations.
* Instead of only using algorithms, I have used hyperparameter tuning techniques to get better results.
* A table at the last shows the comparative study of all the algorithms used.
* I have also explained the reason behind the performance of each and every model on our dataset

### Future Enhancements
* We can try to work again with svm, but with normalised values of data
* It can be also deployed on web
