### House Price Prediction using different machine learning models

### Author: [Tribhuvan Mishra][https://www.linkedin.com/in/tribhuvan0/]

LilHomie is a rapid prototyping project that aims to generate housing appraisals to determine values of properties in the New York Tri-state Area. 

This repository contains the notebook associated with the task performed
* Notebook has well written code along with markdowns, where additional information is given.
* Notebook also has sufficient visualizaations.
* Instead of only using algorithms, I have used hyperparameter tuning techniques to get better results.
* A table at the last shows the comparative study of all the algorithms used.
* I have also explained the reason behind the performance of each and every model on our dataset

### Future Enhancements
* We can try to work again with svm, but with normalised values of data
* It can be also deployed on web
